# Kuzma_CSCI2270_FinalProject
## Project Summary
**Online Phone Directory:** This program will allow people to store their friend's contact in terms of names, phone numbers, and email addresses in a hash table so that other users can search for their friend's contact easily.  One major implementation the hash table will have is the ability to edit an entry.  So if a user entered their data wrong and needed to change any of the three elements of their entry, they will be able to edit by selecting a function to guide them through the process of editing their information.  The user will open the program and a list of options will be presented to the user, which include function such as:
- Inserting an Entry
- Deleting an Entry
- Finding an Entry
- Editing an Entry
- Print Entire Directory
- Exporting the Updated Directory
- Exiting the Program

## How to Run (with Geany)
To run this program, the user will first need to compile the `main.cpp` and `pdirectory.cpp` in the command line:

```
g++ main.cpp pdirectory.cpp -std=c++11
```

Since we are not using hard coding, one will need to enter a command line argument of the desired text file, which in this case is the `CurrentDirectory.txt`:

```
./a.out CurrentDirectory.txt
```

The program will run until you press 7, which as the menu states exits the program.

Follow the prompts as indicated by the program.

Press the desired number from the menu for which you want the program to perform.
